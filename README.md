# Distance-Measurement-using-image-processing
# 📏 Distance Measurement Project

This project calculates the **distance between two objects** using image processing and mathematical formulas. It can be used in various fields such as surveying, medical analysis, industrial automation, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- Detects and measures distance between two points or objects.
- Uses image data and pixel scaling methods.
- Easy-to-use interface.
- Supports uploading custom images.

## 🧠 Project Motivation

In real-world applications, measuring distances manually is not always feasible, especially in risky or precise environments. This project aims to solve this problem by providing an image-based distance measurement system using software, making it safer and more efficient.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend (optional):** Node.js / Express.js
- **Libraries Used:** OpenCV / any image processing library 
- **Other Tools:** Photoshop (for manual reference measurements if applicable)

## 📸 How It Works

1. Upload an image containing the object(s) whose distance is to be measured.
2. Select reference points in the image (with known real-world size).
3. Calculate pixel-to-real-world scale.
4. Measure the pixel distance between desired points.
5. Convert pixel distance to real-world distance.
